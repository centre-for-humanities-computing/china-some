## Topic model
Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling using LDA package in Python (See documentation:https://lda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
LDA is a hierarchical Bayesian model with three levels, in which each item of a collection, in this case tweets, is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. In turn, each topic is modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. An explicit representation of each tweet is provided by the topic probabilities. 

A total of 180 models were trained for both diplomat and media tweets with a variation of the following three hyperparameters:
* Number of Topics (K)
    * The topic model was trained requesting 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 latent topics
* Dirichlet hyperparameter alpha: A-priori document-topic density
    * The topic model was trained using 6 different a-priori beliefs about the document-topic density, including 0.01, 0.31, 0.61, 0.91, symmetric and asymmetric. (symmetric = 1/num_topics, asymmetric = 1/(topic_index + sqrt(num_topics)))
* Dirichlet hyperparameter beta: A-priori word-topic density
    * The topic model was trained using 5 different a-priori beliefs about the word-topic density, including 0.01, 0.31, 0.61, 0.91 and symmetric (symmetric = 1/num_topics)

The model with the best c_v coherence score is chosen for analysis. 



### Usage:
1.  Navigate to the topic model folder
```
cd topic_model
```

2. Install requirements
* Pip install
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Download en_core_web_sm
```
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

3. Lemmatization and cleaning of tweets
```
python preprocess/prep_text.py
```

4. Generate multiple models with a variety of hyperparameters  
```
python preprocess/gen_model.py
```

5. Evaluate the topic models created above, and determining which is the best one
```
python preprocess/eval_model.py
```

When the model has been generated using above commands, run the code in the topic_model.ipynb to visualize the results. Furthermore, visualisations of how prevalent each topic was over time can be found in the topics_over_time.ipynb. 


## Semantic kernel


There are three parameters which can be adjusted:
* First order associations: Indicates the number associations wanted from each of the seeds (Written in uppercase letters along side the seeds in the graph)
* Second order associations: Indicates the number of associations wanted from each of the first order associations. (Written in lowercase in the graph)
* Pruning: Can be set to none, soft and hard. According to the pruning settings, words that are not linked closely enough to the rest of the graph across the hierarchical levels are removed. 

Input given to the model is lists of seeds. Each list should be written as a seperate txt file in the res folder. 

### Usage:
1.  Navigate to the semantic kernel folder
```
cd semantic_kernel
```

2. Prepare data for semantic kernel (the data used is what was preprocessed for the topic model)
```
python prep_semantic/create_subsets.py

python prep_semantic/csv2txt.py -i data/text_diplomat.csv -o data/data_semantic/text_diplomat
python prep_semantic/csv2txt.py -i data/text_diplomat_orig.csv -o data/data_semantic/text_diplomat_orig
```


3. Train model and generate graphs

First time running make sure to set train to True
```
cd semantic_kernel/semantic-kernel

run_diplomats.sh
run_diplomats_orig.sh
```

4. Tweaking of parameters
* Pruning: modify the txt file in prun folder
* First and second order associations: modify the txt file in assoc folder

## Network Analysis
Network analysis performed using the networkx package in python (https://networkx.org/).
Nodes in the networks are Twitter handles and edges (connections) are weighted by the number of mentions between Twitter handles. 
The network visualization only plots Twitter handles that are either flagged as Chinese diplomats or Chinese media outlets, but uses the number of mentions from other twitter users to scale node-size in one network visualization (see below). 
The *edgewidth* (strength of connections) is determined by the number of bi-directional mentions between Twitter handles of Chinese diplomats and media outlets. 
The *nodesize* (size of handle) is determined by various attributes, such as: 
* *unweighted degree*: node-size scaled by the number of unique connections between Twitter handle in question and other Chinese diplomats and media outlets (both directions counted). 
* *weighted degree*: node-size scaled by number of total number of connections  between Twitter handle in question and other Chinese diplomats and media outlets (both directions counted, and each mention counted). 
* *in-degree*: number of mentions from other Chinese diplomats and media outlets to the Twitter handle in question (only one direction counted).
* *out-degree*: number of mentions from the Twitter handle in question to other Chinese diplomats and media outlets (only one direction counted).
* *total mentions*: number of total mentions to the Twitter handle in question from all users (also non-diplomats and non-media). This shows how "popular" the Chinese diplomats and media outlets are on Twitter broadly, rather than just their popularity/activity within the diplomat/media subset. 


### Usage:
1. Navigate to network analysis folder: 

```
cd networks
```

2. Prepare data 
```
python prep_semantic/create_subsets.py

python prep_semantic/csv2txt.py -i data/text_diplomat.csv -o data/data_semantic/text_diplomat
python prep_semantic/csv2txt.py -i data/text_diplomat_orig.csv -o data/data_semantic/text_diplomat_orig
```


3. Train model and generate graphs
First time running make sure to set train to True
```
run_diplomats.sh
run_diplomats_orig.sh
```


4. Tweaking of parameters
* Pruning can be set to none, soft, and hard
